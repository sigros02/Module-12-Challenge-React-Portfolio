## Description

This project is a React-based portfolio designed to showcase web development skills and projects. It's built as a single-page application (SPA) to provide a seamless user experience, allowing potential employers and collaborators to easily navigate through various sections like "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume." This portfolio is deployed on Netlify, ensuring accessibility and a professional presentation.

## User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications,
I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
